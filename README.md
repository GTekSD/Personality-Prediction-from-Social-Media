# Personality Prediction from Social Media
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Instagram have grown in popularity owing to their simplicity of use and user-friendly interfaces that allow users to begin engaging with others in a short amount of time. In these social networking sites (SNSs), each user is treated as an entity, and each entity is linked to other entities as friends, connections, or followers. Many activities are enabled for users when using these SNSs, such as publishing statuses/tweets, sharing others' posts/retweets, like others' posts, commenting on others' posts, talking directly with friends, and playing online games with friends. It is obvious that online behaviour may be portrayed based on user behaviours. Understanding user behaviour may aid in the identification of personality traits. Predicting people' personalities using social media digital footprints is a difficult undertaking since the context of detecting personality traits in social media is not trivial.
